Burgos is split into two sub-projects : burgos and burgos-cli. In order to build one or the other, type :

qmake burgos.pro
OR
qmake burgos-cli.pro

if you want to build both :

qmake all.pro

then just type 

make

If you want to change the build target, juste type
make distclean
then type one of the previous qmake commands.

----------------
Language files :

In order to update the language files, we first need to make a dummy project file containing all source files. For that, type :
qmake -project -o ts.pro
then you can type
lupdate ts.pro
and
lrelease ts.pro
