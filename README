To compile Burgos, execute :
qmake
make

If you just want to build burgos-cli, replace the latter by :
make sub-src-burgos-cli-pro

----------------
Language files :

In order to update the language files, we first need to make a dummy project file containing all source files. For that, type :
qmake -project -o ts.pro
then you can type
lupdate ts.pro
and
lrelease ts.pro

Don't forget to remove ts.pro in order to clean.
